# Lab01-About-Me

### Description
A quiz designed to test a user's knowledge of myself. The app will ask a user five questions, tell the user if they are right or wrong, then display the total number of answers they got correct. Exception handling through the use of try/catch blocks nested in loops will ensure the user can only proceed after entering valid input.

### How to Run
1. Open the About-Me.sln file in Visual Studio.
2. Press F5 to start the program (or ctrl+F5 to start without debugging)
